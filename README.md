## Introduction

Welcome to the Logistic Regression for Titanic Survival Prediction! In this notebook, we explore the famous Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes using logistic regression. The sinking of the Titanic is a historic event, and this analysis provides insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective is to build a predictive model using logistic regression that accurately classifies whether a passenger survived or not. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

## Data Description

The dataset includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, class, and more. The target variable is 'Survived,' indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0). This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between various features and survival outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering: creating new relevant features.
   - Converting categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaling numerical features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing the distribution of variables.
   - Analyzing correlations and patterns in the data.
   - Extracting insights that may inform our predictive model.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Implementing logistic regression as our predictive model.
   - Training the model on the training set.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Utilizing confusion matrices to understand prediction outcomes.
